Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].


There are 3 possibilities:
 * new
 * extend (1 side, both side)
 * merge


Find the interval it's in:
if start  == end:
    if out and out: new
    elif in and in: nothing
elif start == end -1: extend
elif start == end -2 and out and out: extend
else: merge

Binary search
